<title>Auvis Feature: emergency notification and network-wide alerts</title>
</Helmet>

<h2>Some of the main features of Vypress Auvis:</h2>
<ul class='featlist'>
<li>
<strong>Vypress Auvis is software designed for receiving messages</strong>
and notifications from various instant messaging services, such as <a href='/products/messenger/'>
Vypress&nbsp;Messenger</a>, standard WinPopup, Novell NetWare broadcasts 
and any Unix <acronym title='Server Message Block'>SMB</acronym> clients. Auvis was initially developed in response to requests from customers with local networks containing several thousand workstations. 
Therefore, Vypress Auvis is primary oriented for middle and large networks, 
where most of the users are not computer professionals or where strong chat 
restrictions are required.</li>
<li>
<strong>&ldquo;Invisible interface&rdquo;.</strong> The user interface of Auvis was 
designed with the goal of minimizing users interactions with it. The main 
priority of Auvis&rsquo; design is to offer the greatest functionality with minimum 
(or zero) training time to start working with Auvis. Our tests show that people 
without any computer knowledge can start using Auvis immediately after 
installation. Default metrics of the main window of Auvis focus user attention 
on the incoming message text. <em>&ldquo;User interface of the program should be like the 
user interface of the door-handle&rdquo;</em> &mdash; simple and automatic. This is the 
fundamental intent of the Auvis interface design.
</li>
<li>
<strong>A wonderful, lightweight and effective program.</strong> Another 
major requirement that we kept in the mind during Auvis&rsquo; development is the 
effectiveness of the program code. Vypress Auvis was developed in Microsoft 
Visual C++ without using any cumbersome class libraries and components. As a 
result of the hard work of our developers, Auvis uses only about 200 KB of <acronym title='Random Access Memory'>RAM</acronym>! Vypress Auvis will never be a <acronym title='Random Access Memory'>RAM</acronym> consuming program on any PC, even older, low-memory workstations.</li>
<li>
<strong>Advanced flexibility.</strong> Network administrators can 
configure Auvis to fit almost any need. All &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; non-user features of 
Auvis can be configured through special Windows system registry values (see <strong><a href='../kb/regkeys'>Registry Keys of the Vypress Auvis</a></strong> for more information). Using 
these keys, the administrator is able to disable closing of the program, 
disable filtration settings, completely hide the Settings toolbar button, and 
perform many more administrative tasks.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Complete control over message sources.</strong> One essential 
element of a one-way messaging system is control over message sources. Vypress 
Auvis (the first one-way instant messaging system on the market) contains 
features for message source control. Network administrators can allow message 
receiving from only specified workstations or addresses, disable message 
receiving from specified workstations, and restrict high-priority messages 
sources.</li>
<li>
<strong>IP-Multicast support.</strong> Full and complete support for this 
newest <acronym title='Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol'>TCP/IP</acronym> protocol extension allows Vypress Auvis to fit all network topologies and provides an easy and graceful mechanism for multi-destinations messaging.</li>
<li>
<strong>Built-in checking for new incoming e-mail messages.</strong> Vypress 
Auvis can check for new e-mail messages on <acronym title='Post Office Protocol 3'>POP3</acronym> or <acronym title='Internet Messaging Access Protocol 4'>IMAP4</acronym> incoming mail servers. 
This feature consummates messaging control, allowing true control of all 
incoming messages.</li>
<li>
<strong>Easy implementation and deployment.</strong> As a product 
initially designed for use in large networks, Auvis has all the essential 
features for enterprise-wide deployment, such as silent setup and <acronym title='System Management Server'>SMS</acronym> integrations. Auvis can be started from any location and any working folder, 
from the registry key, from the &ldquo;StartUp&rdquo; group or from login script. The 
experts from the <a href='/support/'>VyPRESS Support Team</a> will help you 
design implementation and deployment plans for personalizing your corporate 
network and solving all possible problems, quickly and easily.</li>
