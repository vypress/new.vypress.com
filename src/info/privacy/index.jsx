<h2>VyPRESS.com Privacy Statement</h2>
			
<p>At VyPRESS Research, your security and privacy is of the utmost importance to us. We take the following steps to protect your personal information:
</p>

<h4>PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>
<p>VyPRESS Research collects basic contact information when you subscribe to newsletter or fill in a contact form. This information will be used for administrative and identification purposes only and will not be shared with our partners or third parties. Personal information is stored on VyPRESS Research computers and is only accessed by authorized VyPRESS Research personnel.
</p>

<h4>COOKIES</h4>
<p>VyPRESS Research uses a cookie to store your visiting and referrer information. A cookie is a small text file, stored on your computer's hard drive, that can be read by our system when you return to our site.</p>

<h4>GENERAL INFORMATION</h4>
<p>VyPRESS Research also collects general demographic information about visitors to our site. The information we collect creates a broad picture of our population rather than focusing on any one individual. This information is used to continually refine our products and to identify the most popular areas of our site.
</p>

<h4>DISCUSSION AREA</h4>
<p>VyPRESS Research hosts chat and discussion area in our site environment. Any information divulged in this area may be observed by other people and should not be considered secure. VyPRESS Research is not responsible for the actions of our visitors. We cannot be responsible for maintaining the privacy of correspondence carried on outside of our editorial environment.
</p>

<h4>ENCRYPTED CREDIT CARD PURCHASES</h4>
<p>If you use a credit card to purchase a VyPRESS Research product, the credit card number is encrypted as it passes over the Internet. Your credit card number is not kept or recorded by VyPRESS Research or our computers - it is simply passed through to the credit card company to purchase the course. In this respect, buying a course from VyPRESS Research is similar to a credit card purchase at any store. Neither VyPRESS Research nor the store keeps your credit card number on file.
</p>
<p>More than anything, VyPRESS Research tries to treat its customers as each one of us would like to be treated. We value our privacy and we value yours, too. It is our goal to make your experience with VyPRESS Research a safe and positive experience.
