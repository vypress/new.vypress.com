<p>Welcome!</p>

<p>First of all, we would like to notify you that all our software has <nobr>a 31-day no-limitations</nobr> trial period &mdash; just download a trial version at our <a href="/downloads/"><b>Downloads page</b></a> and feel free to &ldquo;test drive&rdquo; it on your network. Have you already tried it, loved it and would like to use it longer than the trial period? Then this is <i>the</i> place where you can purchase the license.</p>

<p>After placing the order, you receive a digital KEYfile that you should enter into the trial version to unlock it and continue using the software without any time and functionality limitations. In case of the &ldquo;unlimited license&rdquo; order, you receive a special build that doesn&rsquo;t require any license management or additional KEYfiles. You should expect the digital KEYfile to arrive within 48 hours after placing the order, as an attachment <nobr>to an e-mail</nobr>, so please make sure you provide a correct and working <nobr>e-mail</nobr> address that is able to receive e-mails with attachments.</p>

<p>The fastest, easiest and most secure way to purchase a license is to <a href="online/"><b>buy it online</b></a> at a secure server and pay using a credit or debit card. However, there are many <b><a href="options">alternative methods of payment</a></b>, including <a href="options/#PO"><b>Purchase Orders</b></a> for large organizations that can&rsquo;t pay online.</p>

<p>And the most incredible thing: you pay for the program just once and get all of the new versions of this program for FREE and for LIFE.</p>
